When it comes to hiring in technology, many times it depends on who you know. Many entry-level employees get those connections that lead to full-time jobs through internships. Many internships in technology are paid, making them fantastic opportunities to get paid while you learn new technology skills.

### Before you apply
To have the best chance for getting a paid internship, you should have some familiarity with coding or the skills you'll be doing in the internship. Now you may ask, "But wait! How do I get the experience to get experience?" 

The answer is [self-taught projects], side-projects and or [formal education].

### Show off your skills: resumes and online profiles

In order to get an interview, you need to effectively show employers how kick-ass you are. You need at least two things to do this: a traditional resume and an online portfolio with your projects. 

#### How to write a resume
You should be able to write a resume when sending in a job application. Here's the tips for that.

#### How to create an online portfolio
A portfolio with your coding projects [will increase your chances of getting an interview](http://news.dice.com/2012/06/18/coding-portfolio-resume/). Here's how you can create one.

* [How do I make a great portfolio website](https://www.lessannoyingcrm.com/blog/Programmer_Portfolio)

#### How to create a Github profile
Additionally, many organizations use collaborative coding tools such as Github or Bitbucket. These websites do more than manage code, they also track and show off how much code you ship.

### Interviews

Once you send your resumes to tech companies, you will be called in for an interview. Technical interviews are different from your typical interview, but easy to prepare for. Study [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/098478280X), a book outlining 150 different programming questions and solutions similar to questions your interviewers will be asking. Borrow it from a friend or check it out at the library.
