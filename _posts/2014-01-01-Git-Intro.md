You don’t have to be an engineer to appreciate git. If you’ve ever struggled to track your changes in a simple Word document, you know that it can be challenging to track past edits. Git is a version control system -- that is, it allows you to save and track incremental changes to your work. Should you ever want to undo a revision, or look back on your code’s progress over time, you can do it with git.

Being able to use git gives you a huge advantage in collaborative projects as well. How else to coordinate the efforts of multiple people all working on one project? Companies large and small use git to coordinate code changes made by different programmers.

Additionally, employers frequently look at candidates’ work on GitHub, an online, public storage space for source code. Sending a potential employer a link to a GitHub folder (“repository”) can be a great way to showcase your ability.
