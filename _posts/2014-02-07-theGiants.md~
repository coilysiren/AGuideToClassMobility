Talk about basic stuff. Like, assume the reader wasn't previously aware that Microsoft has like 70% market share. Why do people love Apple? What's a startup?

There are three catergories here:

broad information - what is a startup, what are copyrights, privacy as a broad category of thing

history - "at the dawn of time there was unix", also this is where the microsoft, apple, etc stuff comes in

present and future - What are the current and future most influential culture forces in tech. Like reddit, hacker news, whatever
