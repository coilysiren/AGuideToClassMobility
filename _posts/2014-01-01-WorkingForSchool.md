Many part time jobs provide additional benefits focused on helping you complete courses in higher education. These companies will provide benefits and tuition assistance above and beyond your paycheck. Taking advantage of these programs can make a huge difference when attempting to balance school and work, especially when the work itself is solely in support of your greater goals.

The following 30-odd companies provide some form of tuition assistance, as well as full health benefits for part time workers:

###General Advice###
Quite a few folks start out in non technical positions within a company, learned some useful, bottom level IT skills that they could take over, and slowly became "real" IT folks. Companies are often supportive of this path; willing to pay for classes, especially if it is expanding on your current job description.
